# Seismic-Trend-Analysis

Tools/Techniques : Python, Random Forest Classifier,
Gradient Boosting
•Aims to analyse earthquake magnitudes and
probabilities in various regions using historical seismic
data.
•By applying machine learning models to analyse key
seismic indicators, the project provides critical insights
for improving early warning systems and disaster
preparedness.
